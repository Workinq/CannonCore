Cannon core is a plugin which adds lots of useful features which improve a cannoner's experience with handy tools, etc.

At the moment, features are somewhat limited however, I'll be adding more in the future. Below is a list of all the current features this plugin has to offer.

- **RemoteButton** - This is a really handy feature which allows you to select a button which you can fire remotely by executing one of two commands: `/button fire` or `/fire`. Another feature included with this is the command `/button hold [time]`, what this does is it will hold the button for a given time. If you type the command without the `[time]` parameter, the button will stay on infinitely long. The `[time]` parameter must be a whole integer, if it's not then it will be rounded to the nearest one. In the future I will consider adding the ability to use floats, e.g. `1.5` rather than just `2`. With this module, you also get the command `/button reset` which will reset your button selection. At the moment, as soon as you press a button, it will be used as the remote button and until you type `/button reset`, you won't be able to select another button so for this reason I might make a command called `/button select` so you don't select a button by accident.

- **TickCounter** - This is another really useful feature, what this does is allows you to count the number of ticks on repeaters by clicking on them with a special item which you can get by executing the command `/tickcounter [give <player> [amount]]`. To count ticks, you left click or right click a repeater and you will be sent a message showing you how many ticks you currently have. To reset the tick selection, all you have to do is left click or right click the air.

- **TNTSound** - Ever wanted to just cannon peacefully without any TNT sound? Well this plugin does just that, TNT sounds can become quite annoying and you might want to hear other blocks so turning off block sounds in your settings will be a bit annoying. So, to combat this, the plugin has a command `/tntsound` which will result in all TNT sounds being disabled once and for all. *If you want to re-enable sounds then just type the command out again.*

- **XRay** - XRay is a really cool feature which even I was pretty proud of when I made it, what it does is clears out a given radius and converts all of the blocks to barriers, this in hand means that you are able to see through your cannon or a wall so you can see if there are any problems going in within your cannon. To enable this, all you have to do is execute `/xray` and you're good to go! At the moment there is no way to change what material the blocks are converted to when XRay is enabled however, I can easily add that in the future by appending a new variable to the configuration file. The good nows is that the radius **can** be configured.

- **Core** - Normally commands like these aren't anything too special however, I made some pretty neat features in this one.
  - **Reload** - When typing `/core reload`, all of the configuration files will be reloaded in case you modified them.
  - **Config** - This command has a fairly long syntax so I'll go over each parameter in detail. The syntax is as follows: `/core config <config> <path> <value>`. The `<config>` parameter is the configuration file which you want to modify, since there are lots of configuration files generated when using this plugin, I thought it would be beneficial to add an in-game command to edit these commands meaning you wouldn't have to go to your server directory and edit them from there. Back to the point, the `<config>` parameter takes the name of the configuration file which you want to edit, an example would be `xray`. Next is the `<path>` parameter, this parameter is the path for the config variable you want to change, since I'm using `xray` as an example for a config to edit, I'm going to use `radius` as the `<path>` parameter.  Next is the `<value>` parameter, this will be the new value which you want to change the `path` to, as an example I'll use `8` meaning the radius of the XRay command will be 8 blocks.
    - **Example** - An example of this syntax is as follows: `/core config xray radius 8` where `xray` is the configuration to edit, `radius` is the path to change and `8` is the new value to set.
    
That's it for the plugin, if you want any new features added then message me on Discord @ Kieraaaan#6612 or any other forum site which I might be on.
